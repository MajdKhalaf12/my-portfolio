How did we discover fire ? the first image comes to your mind it might be whom he did was curios and searching in the nature, when he saw the fire asked himself what is it? then he wanted to use it as it gives a benefit, if you believed in that you got fooled as happened with me by the capitalist marketing of people like Steve jobs and his discovery "iPhone", as I see curiosity marketing started with 20<sup>th</sup> century to push people to make more money, I don't deny the existence of curiosity but it is not and it should not be the main element to push you I'd say.

before I tell you what to I started to see as a good push now here's a short story happened with Socrates

> _“A young man asked Socrates the secret to success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning. They met and Socrates asked the young man to walk with him toward the river. When the water got up to their necks, Socrates took the young man by surprise and pushed him under the water. The boy struggled to get out but Socrates kept him there. When the boy started turning blue, Socrates raised the boy’s head out of the water. The first thing the boy did was to take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, “What did you want the most when you were under water?” The boy replied, “Air.” Socrates said, “That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted air underwater, you will have it.” There is no other secret. This is called the burning desire.” [Source](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7419205-a-young-man-asked-socrates-the-secret-to-success-socrates)_

I'd say in other it's Survival all along what made our ancestors do things previously, the man responsibility to hunt and use fire against predators, to survive during the industrial revolution, moreover see what you've done in creative vs the survival mode in Minecraft, which one feels you are pushed to do, to build a house before sunset and keep going and discover the world besides building your own wonders here where you felt responsible and what pushed you was survival feeling.

do you know who doesn't think in survival and can be carless, woman and children but not men, men can not be carless because if your curiosity dies you will not continue doing your thing but if your survival dies you die with it, moreover if I felt I need to survive I will not care about the emotions of boredom, anger, and lust but will focus to do what makes me survive, then you will have that you called perseverance.

You might tell me I have more than bare minimum, I would say a king and his kingdom survive among other kingdoms. farewell
